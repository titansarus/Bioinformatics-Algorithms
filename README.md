Answer to "Bioinformatics Algorithms" Book Coding Problems


* I wrote these codes as Homework in the "Introduction to Bioinformatics" course at the Sharif University of Technology.
* Course Instructors: Dr. Ali Sharifi-Zarchi & Dr. Somayyeh Koohi
* The problems are hosted here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track.
* The codes are accepted on Rosalind and will probably work fine, but I do not guarantee that I handled all corner cases, so use at your own risk.
