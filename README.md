Answer to "Bioinformatics Algorithms" Book Coding Problems


* These are the codes that I wrote as Homeworks in "Introduction to Bioinformatics" course at Sharif University of Technology.

* Course Instructors: Dr. Ali Sharifi-Zarchi & Dr. Somayyeh Koohi

* The problems are hosted here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track

* The codes are accepted on Rosalind and will probably work fine, but I do not guarantee that all corner cases are handled, so use at your own risk.
